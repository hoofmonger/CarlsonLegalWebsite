    <h2 class="aboutMe" href="aboutMe">About Dianne</h2>
    <p class="aboutMeText">
      I am a collaborator by nature, working to connect people and ideas that
      are made for each other. I welcome opportunities to become involved with
      companies or individuals that have crossed, or are looking to cross,
      national borders to expand their business. My passion is to find the best
      way to address, manage and resolve issues facing multi-national companies
      in areas involving employment and labor law, including regulations;
      litigation; dispute resolution; and best practices to ensure global legal
      compliance. Topics about which I have deep experience include: legal and
      corporate strategy regarding cross-border employment integration or
      management; dispute resolution strategies; executive and Board-level
      advice in matters arising from global activities; professional and
      corporate training and education; governance practices, policies and
      processes; expatriate and global employment organizational structure
      assessments and re-design; cross-border audits and investigations,
      including assessment of attorney/client privilege and discovery issues;
      FCPA programs and training from an employment perspective; preventative
      practices; change management; cross-organizational relationships; and
      articles and presentations involving any of these topics. I seek
      opportunities to work on complex and often crisis situations, the
      resolutions for which may require creative and outside-the-box thinking. I
      love the challenge of helping companies and their leadership protect their
      assets and creatively honor their human capital.

          I have known Dianne Carlson for over five years and a number of

          high level of performance was always aligned with my goals. What a
